	testDrive.c

Methodology:

	I chose to implement this with a linked list
	since it seemed more straight-forward to implement.
	In the mymalloc.c program I created a Node struct with
	an int signifiying if the node block is free or used
	currently.  It also has an int indicating the block size
	and references to the next and previous blocks in the list.
	In the rest of the class I maintain a head, tail and current
	Node object to iterating and reference data segments in the
	heap.  For the function methodology I implemented the
	algorithm described in class and in the assignmenr
	description of worstFit.
