# COE 0449 Systems Software
Fall 2018 Systems Software Projects

All programs were developed and run in a server UNIX enviornment

## Projects
- Project 1
  
    Simple C I/O program for detecting critical points in a sine wave 

- Project 2

    Implementation of a circular, doubly linked-list in C

- Project 3

    Project where I had fine the password in 3 executables with varying levels of difficulty.  Also a custom strings implementation similar to UNIX `strings`

- Project 4

    Custom `malloc` implementation using a linked-list and first-fit algorithm

- Project 5

    Simple multi-threaded download program from one port to another on a local machine utilizing `pthread` in conjuction with socket programming

## Labs

- Lab 5

    Program to take a list of numbers and compress them by converting to binary and removing extra unused bits then decompress them

- Lab 6

    Implementation of a heap walk algorithm for a worst-fit allocation scheme

- Lab 7
